![Soilit Logo](app/src/main/res/drawable/logo.png)

Welcome to the Soilit Android application! This project utilizes machine learning and cloud computing to detect soil properties and provide analysis on Android devices.

## Overview

Soilit is an Android application designed to help users analyze soil properties using machine learning algorithms and cloud computing. The application allows users to capture soil images using their smartphone's camera and provides instant analysis and insights about the soil composition, fertility, moisture content, and more.

## Features

- Soil image capture using the smartphone's camera.
- Machine learning algorithms for soil analysis.
- Cloud computing for data processing and analysis.
- Real-time soil property results and recommendations.
- User-friendly interface and intuitive design.
